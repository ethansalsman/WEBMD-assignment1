    How do I sign up?
    Go to our online form where you can enter your registration information.
    Remember that the registration desk is closed the night before the 
    event.
    
    
    What is the minimum fund-raising total I have to raise?
    There is no minimum sponsorship target. Any total will help in the cause.
    Just try and raise as much as you can. 
    
    
    Will I receive a shirt to wear at the race?
    Yes! We will be sending out a state of the art running vest or T-shirt 
    to you in the post about a month before race day. Please remember to 
    specify which vest or T-shirt size you would like when 
    confirming your place.
    
    
    When will my registration pack arrive?
    We will mail out your registration pack in the post within two weeks 
    of your registration. If you have not received the pack within that
    time, please contact us.
    
    
    What does it cost to register?
    $35 for the 5K/10K race. The 1-Mile Fun Runs are free.      
    
    
    What happens during the race?
    Please visit the Race Info page for all 
    details on what to expect on race day.
    
    
    Will the race be cancelled if it rains?
    This event will occur rain or shine. We suggest ponchos and rain 
    gear if it does happen to rain. All registration fees and donations 
    are non-refundable in the event of rain. 
    
    
    Do I need to register my child?
    Yes, if your child is participating in the 5K/10K races. There is no
    need to register children for the 1 Mile Fun Run.
    
    
    Can I bring my pet?
    Pets are discouraged at the race. There are over 2000 people competing in the race
    and it is too crowded to accommodate  pets.
    
    
    Where do I park?
    The earlier you arrive at the race site, the easier parking will be! 
    You may park on the streets as long as you are not blocking driveways or
    residential streets. We encourage you to carpool with your team or 
    other participants if possible.                   
    
    
    Can I collect sponsorship online?
    Yes. You can sign up at several web charity organizers and follow 
    their easy step by step guide to create your own online fund-raising page. 
    All money raised through your page will be automatically sent through to 
    us and allocated to your record.
    
    
    How do I withdraw from the event?
    The registration pack will include an official event magazine with withdrawal 
    instructions. Complete the withdrawal form and send it to the race organizers along
    with the race gear and timing chip. A $10 organizational fee will be charged 
    to all withdrawals.
    
    
    I am looking for accommodation for the event, where is best to stay?
    We are partnering with the Cheyenne Chamber of Commerce to direct visiting
    runners for places to stay. Low-cost camping is available in Prairie Park.
